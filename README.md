# **Repository for our Mini project (Eye for blind)**
**Problem defination**

*One of the problem for visually impaired individuals is that they are mostly been cheated during money transactions such as they are not able to distinguish between different currency and also they face difficulty in taking their medicines as most of the medicine tablets are in same in size so, they face difficulty in identifying that which medicine they need to take in what quantity and at what time.* 

**Objective of the project**

*The main objective of this project work is to help the visually impaired individual(blind person) by protecting them from getting cheated in terms of money transaction and also to reduce their dependence on other people for taking right medicines in right quantity at right time. To fill this main objective, we have identified the following objectives for the proposed work.*

- To build a machine learning model for currency detection
- Also to develop an algorithm using Image processing and OCR to guide them with proper medicines with correct dozes
